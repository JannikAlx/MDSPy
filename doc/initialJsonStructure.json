  "Lyric": "Lock down what do we make of this madness it's a world gone mad\r\nShot down identity unknown mistaken for the enemy\r\nArtillery placed in the hands of a few psychosomatic rebellion\r\nCollateral damage here comes the shrapnel again piercing screams in my head\r\n\r\nBlackened shattered remains a season of change\r\nAnger and fear fuel the fire\r\n\r\nBlinded blind to the eyes of the world under a jaded sky\r\nRapture heaven of hellfire we are fractured again\r\nSilenced from the underground\r\nRobbing the blind and steal from the dead\r\n\r\nBlackened shattered remains a season of change\r\nAnger and fear fuel the fire\r\nHellfire\r\n\r\nBlackened shattered remains a season of change\r\nAnger and fear fuel the fire\r\nTragic, loss and despair no rhyme or reason\r\nBlackened shattered remains black are the souls that tear down humanity\r\nWhat will you do when they come for you\r\nThey're closing in, they're coming, fight for your life",
